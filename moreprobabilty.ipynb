    "To untangle a probability problem, all you have to do is define exactly what the cases are, and carefully count the favorable and total cases. Let's be clear on our vocabulary words:\n",

    "Trial: A single occurrence with an outcome that is uncertain until it happens.\n",
    "For example, rolling a single die.\n",
    "Outcome: A possible result of a trial; one particular state of the world. What Laplace calls a case.\n",
    "For example: the die comes up as 4.\n",
    "Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes for the trial.\n",
    "For example, {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}.\n",
    "Event: A subset of the sample space, a set of outcomes that together have some property we are interested in.\n",
    "For example, the event \"even die roll\" is the set of outcomes {2, 4, 6}.\n",
    "Probability: As Laplace said, the probability of an event with respect to a sample space is the \"number of favorable cases\" (outcomes from the sample space that are in the event) divided by the \"number of all the cases\" in the sample space, assuming \"nothing leads us to expect that any one of these cases should occur more than any other.\" Since this is a proper fraction, probability will always be a number between 0 (representing an impossible event) and 1 (representing a certain event).\n",
    "For example, the probability of an even die roll is 3/6 = 1/2.\n",
    "This notebook will explore these concepts in a concrete way using Python code. The code is meant to be succint and explicit, and fast enough to handle sample spaces with millions of outcomes. If you need to handle trillions, you'll want a more efficient implementation. I also have another notebook that covers paradoxes in Probability Theory."
